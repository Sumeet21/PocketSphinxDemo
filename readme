 Offline Speech Recognition With PocketSphinx
Follow the below steps to run AndroidPocketSphinxDemo project provided by Sphinx community:

1. Download the latest version of sphinxbase from the following link:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/sphinxbase/
    Extract the downloaded tar file and save it under a folder called 'sphinx' .

2. Download the latest version of pocketsphinx from the link:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/cmusphinx/files/pocketsphinx
    Extract the downloaded tar file and save it under a folder named 'sphinx' .

3. After extracting sphinxbase and pocketsphinx, you will have to install both 
    in your system through the following commands,

        cd <sphinxbase path or pocketsphinx path>
        ./configure
        make
        make install

4. Make sure that you have installed Android NDK, if not installed, refer
    the link:
    http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

5. Download AndroidPocketSphinxDemo project from the link:
    https://github.com/cjac/cmusphinx/tree/trunk/PocketSphinxAndroidDemo

6. Copy the following files from <pocketsphinx path>/swig/edu/cmu/pocketsphinx
    to PocketSphinxDemo/jni/edu.cmu.pocketsphinx. The required files are:

        Config.java
        Decoder.java
        Hypothesis.java
        pocketsphinx.java
        pocketsphinxJNI.java
        SegmentIterator.java



7. Specify the path of 'sphinx' folder containing pocketsphinx and sphinxbase in
    'Android.mk' file. Then do Ndk build.

8. In the emulator/device in which you are going to install the project, create the
    folder called 'edu.cmu.pocketsphinx' under the path '/sdcard/Android/data/' .
   
9. Under the folder 'edu.cmu.pocketsphinx', create two folders called 'hmm' and
    'lm'. Under both 'hmm' and 'lm' create folder called 'en_US'.

10. Inside '/sdcard/Android/data/edu.cmu.pocketsphinx/hmm/en_US', copy the
      folder 'hub4wsj_sc_8k' present under   
      <pocketsphinx path>/model/hmm/en_US

11. Inside  '/sdcard/Android/data/edu.cmu.pocketsphinx/lm/en_US', copy the files
      'hub4.5000.dic' and 'hub4.5000.DMP' present under
      <pocketsphinx path>/model/lm/en_US

12. Now the project is ready to run on the emualtor/device.
